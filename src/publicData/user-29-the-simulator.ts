    description: `Tangent isn't just some random wave—it’s the shadow of a deeper relationship. Imagine a right triangle spinning endlessly on the unit circle. Tangent is the ratio of how high the triangle stretches (opposite side) to how far it reaches across (adjacent side). But here's the catch: when you point straight up or down (at 90° and -90°), there's no 'adjacent' left—it vanishes! That’s where tangent heads off to infinity, creating those vertical asymptotes. It's chaos with structure, infinity bound by rules.`,

Morning is a busy time for squirrels as they emerge from their nests, typically built in tree cavities or leafy dreys. Their first order of business is to forage for food. Squirrels are primarily herbivorous and their diet consists of a wide range of nuts, seeds, fruits, berries, fungi, and plant material. They have excellent spatial memory and often bury food in various locations, relying on their keen sense of smell to retrieve it later.`,

  `Blender can feel like a Jet2Holiday sometimes‚Ä¶ Cloth explodes, fluids glitch, pink textures everywhere‚Ä¶ It feels like even simple stuff takes hours because nothing works how it should. But once you finally understand the systems, it all starts to click - and suddenly this mess turns into one of the most powerful tools you‚Äôll ever use as a creative. That‚Äôs exactly why I created a step-by-step Blueprint for artists who want to skip the years of trial and error and actually start freelancing with Blender. Comment freelance if you want me to send you something helpful that‚Äôll guide you to the exact systems I use to make a full-time income as a Blender artist. PS: Some accounts require you to follow me so I can DM you ‚Äì so drop a follow to make sure I can send it over.`, /*1*/
  `In Blender everything starts with the default cube. A timeless classic - but when I first opened Blender, I had no clue what I was doing. Back then, I was ambitious but lost. Now, after helping others become full-time 3D freelancers, I realized most struggle with the same first step: Where do I even start? That‚Äôs why I created the Full-Time Blender3D Blueprint - a full guide to learning Blender, getting clients, and making money with 3D. Comment ‚Äúfreelance‚Äù and I‚Äôll send you something free to get started üöÄ PS some accounts require you to follow me so I‚Äôm able to send you a DM - so drop a follow to make sure I can message you`, /*2*/
